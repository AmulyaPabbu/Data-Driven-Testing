# Data-Driven-Testing

Here I practiced working on a feature "Fixed Deposit Calculator"
Where I pass different fields such as Principal amount, Rate of interest (roi), Frequency, Period (days/months/years), and finally calculate maturity value
By passing these fields from excel, reading data from excel, comparing expected and actual values of maturity value, then writing data into excel (updating the status column)
